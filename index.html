                <pre><code>echo "*/30 * $(date +%d) $(date +%m) * echo \"Task scheduled at "'$(date)'"\""</code></pre>
            
            <p><strong>2. Copy and paste the output and append it to the bottom of your crontab which you can open up by pasting this command:</strong><br>
            !! BEWARE THAT PASTING THIS COMMAND MIGHT CLEAR YOUR TERMINAL !!<br>
            !! 		  However, in most cases you can just scroll up  	  !!<br></p>
                <pre><code>crontab -e</code></pre>
                
            <p><strong>3. Now make sure crontab is running by using this command:</strong></p>
                <pre><code>sudo systemctl status crond</code></pre>
            
            <p>If it says <span style="color:#009900;">active (running)</span> near the top left corner, breathe out, <strong>YOU ARE DONE</strong><br>
            <br>
            If it says inactive (dead) near the top left corner, well, lets try starting it.<br>
            <br>
            <strong>4. !!ONLY IF INACTIVE!! - Run this command to start the service</strong></p>
                <pre><code>sudo service crond start</code></pre>
                
            <p>Now you can go back to step 3 and retry. If it fails again, you might have to read the status message to get a bearing on what's going wrong.</p>

The script should when started list a menu for the user with the different questions that can be chosen and which corresponding letter the user will have to give as input to display the answer of the desired question. One of the possible inputs the user should be able to make is "q" for quitting the script. The menu should also have a defaultcase where all the items is displayed again,or no changes is made if the user gives an invalid input.Hint: use a switch case to be able to handle the menu.
